The Chamber Leads Group reflects serious business professionals that have the desire to effectively expand their business by forming relationships with other chamber members for the purpose of exchanging direct client referrals. This group meets twice a month on Tuesday mornings from 8:00 am to 9:00 am at the Old Town Hall, 611 Old Post Road, Fairfield – 2nd floor conference room. The purpose of these meetings is to help members establish relationships and really get to know one another so that they can recognize opportunities to refer business when the occasion presents itself. In general, people would rather do business with a known entity, and providing a referral reduces the risk factor for the buyer because a recommendation carries high value. To be a member of the Business Development Leads Group, one must be a member of the Fairfield Chamber of Commerce in good standing. The Business Development Group follows a non-competing format and is limited to one person per industry and/or profession, with slots being filled on a first come, first served basis. If an industry slot is filled, a person can be added to a wait list by contacting the Facilitator. Membership dues are $75 per year.",
