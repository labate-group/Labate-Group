            "text": "The Boondocks refers to a poor rural area. There is a song from 1960s. \"Down in the Boondocks\" about a poor boy in love with a rich girl in United States.\n\nThe boondocks is an American expression from the Tagalog word bundók (\"mountain\"). It originally referred to a remote rural area, but now, is often applied to an out-of-the-way area considered backward and unsophisticated by city-folk.\n\nIt can also refer to a mountain.\n\nA road in the boondocks of Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania\n\nThe expression was introduced to English by U.S. military personnel fighting in the Philippine–American War (1899-1902). It derives from the Tagalog word \"bundók\", which means \"mountain\". According to military historian Paul A. Kramer, the term originally had \"connotations of bewilderment and confusion\", due to the guerrilla warfare in which the soldiers were engaged.\n\nIn the Philippines, the word bundók is also a colloquialism referring to rural inland areas, which are usually mountainous and difficult to access, as most major cities and settlements in the Philippines are located in lowlands or near the coastline.\n\nEquivalent terms include the Spanish-derived probinsiya (\"province\") and the Cebuano term bukid (\"mountain\"). When used generally, the term refers to a rustic or uncivilized area. When referring to people (taga-bundok or probinsiyano in Tagalog; taga-bukid in Cebuano; English: \"someone who comes from the mountains/provinces\"), it acquires a derogatory connotation of a stereotype of unsophisticated, ignorant, and illiterate country people.\n\nThe term evolved into American slang to refer to the countryside or isolated rural/wilderness area, regardless of topography or vegetation. Similar slang or colloquial words are \"the sticks\", \"the wops\", \"the backblocks\", or \"Woop Woop\" in Australia, \"the wop-wops\" in New Zealand, \"bundu\" in South Africa (etymologically unrelated to \"boondocks\" or \"bundok\"), \"out in the weeds\" in New Brunswick and \"out in the tules\" in California. The diminutive \"boonies\" can be heard in films about the Vietnam War such as Brian De Palma's Casualties of War (1989) used by American soldiers to designate rural areas of Vietnam.\n\nBoondocking refers to camping with a recreational vehicle (RV) in a remote location without the water, power, or sewer infrastructure that is available at campgrounds or RV parks.\n\nThe song \"Down in the Boondocks\" where the poor boy lived and he loved the Rich girl. By Billy Joe Royal.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/v4CeR9Mkjs4\n",

American troops - especially those from the US Marine Corps - were stationed in the Philippines during World War II. If they weren’t in a firebase, or a basecamp, or an urban area, they were out in the wild - they adopted the word ‘boondocks’ from a Tagalog word bundock, meaning ‘’a mountain’, to refer to such a wild place. Back home in the USA, ‘the boondocks’ came to mean the same as ‘the sticks’ or ‘the back of beyond’ - a rural or wild place which is unattractive because it’s so isolated, so remote from the excitement of urban life. “out in the boondocks’ and ‘down in the boondocks’ express this idea.",
