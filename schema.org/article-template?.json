						"@type": "Answer",

If you choose the business credit card route, you’ll need a strong personal credit history to qualify. If you are two years into your startup phase and applying for a startup loan to fund your next level of growth, many lenders require your business to show annual revenue of at least $100,000. In the SBA loan category, you’ll also need to invest at least 20% of the loan amount as a down payment.<\/p>"

Whether your startup is in its first week and has not earned its first dollar yet, or your company is in its fifth year borrowing for a new location or additional equipment, banks have programs for you. Most bank programs will require heavy documentation during the application process, and they could range from a business bank credit card to a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/110614/what-difference-between-loan-and-line-credit.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">business line of credit<\/a> to a short-term or long-term loan.<\/p>"

There are lenders that will use the equipment itself as collateral, thus reducing risk and eliminating the need for a down payment. Some other ways to get a business loan with no money down are business credit cards, short-term loans, and lines of credit. Working capital bridge loans and merchant cash advances may also be options for your business to get a loan with no money down.<\/p>"
